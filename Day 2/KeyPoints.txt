Introduction
Node.js gives the functionality of File I/O by providing wrappers around the standard POSIX functions. In Node.js, File I/O methods can be performed in both synchronous as well as asynchronous form depending upon the user requirements. In order to use this functionalities we need to require the fs module as shown below :
									
var fs = require('fs'); test
